### The main goal of this project is to create a display for my desk that shows that current day's comic. As of right now this is based on the [5.65inch ACeP 7-Color E-Paper from waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/5.65inch-e-paper-module-f.htm) and an RPI 

The main idea is that the RPI will web scrape for the comic strip image and then convert it from GIF to BMP format. Then, with the newly formated image it will be displayed. Thank you Robert W. Floyd and Louis Steinberg for creating the first image [dithering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering)
